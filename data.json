The two American technology companies were in a dispute over several thousand lines of computer code written by Oracle. The company said that Google had violated U.S. copyright law by copying the computer commands within one of its software products. Google added the Oracle code to its own while developing the Android operating system. The code was used to create an application software interface, or API, for Android. APIs are the pieces of code that permit programs and apps to work together. Software developers have created millions of apps for Android. The operating system now powers more than 70 percent of the world's mobile devices. The Android system was released in 2007. To build it, Google wrote millions of lines of new computer code. But it also used about 11,500 lines of code copyrighted as part of Oracle's Java programming language. Oracle brought legal action against Google for violating its copyright and sought billions of dollars in payment. In a 6 to 2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court\u2019s ruling that Google\u2019s use of Oracle\u2019s code in Android was a copyright violation. Instead, the court ruled that Google\u2019s copying was lawfully permitted as \u201cfair use.\u201d In his opinion for the court's majority, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that Google\u2019s copying \"took only what was needed\" and was \u201ctransformative.\" This is a word the court has used to describe copying \u201cthat adds something new and important.\u201d The legal dispute had continued in several courts for 10 years. Google won the first case when a judge rejected Oracle\u2019s copyright claim. But that ruling was overturned by an appeals court. A jury then sided with Google, but an appeals court again disagreed. Google had argued that it did not copy a computer program, but only used elements of the Java language in the development of its Android API. It added that using code in such a way had become common in the technology industry and that the practice was good for technical progress. Google further explained that there can be no copyright protection for the purely operational, noncreative computer code it used. In a statement after the ruling, Oracle\u2019s executive vice president and general legal counsel, Dorian Daley, strongly disagreed with those arguments. She said Google \u201cstole Java\u201d and spent 10 years pressing its legal case \u201conly as a monopolist can.\u201d \u201cThis behavior is exactly why (governments) around the world and in the United States are examining Google's business practices,\" Daley added. Google's senior vice president for global relations, Kent Walker, praised the court\u2019s ruling. \"The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit\u201d the public, he said. Justice Clarence Thomas gave a dissenting opinion for the court that was joined by Justice Samuel Alito. The opinion said the court should have supported Oracle's copyright. It called the ruling \"anything but fair\" and noted that Apple and Microsoft had not copied to create their mobile operating systems. Thomas wrote that the decision will harm competition. He argued the ruling will make it easier for \"companies to \u201cfreely copy libraries of declaring code whenever it is more convenient than writing their own.\u201d This, Thomas argues, will leave companies less willing to heavily invest as Oracle did to create \u201cwell-organized libraries\u201d to compete with Android. Matt Schruers is president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association. He praised the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling and said an Oracle victory would have harmed competition. He said that permitting fair use of programming elements will help technology companies create \u201ccompeting, interoperable\u201d products. I\u2019m Bryan Lynn.

She speaks, jokes, sings and even makes art. Now, the next step in the robot\u2019s career could be that of a musician. Sophia is working with human musicians on several musical works as part of a project called Sophia Pop, said David Hanson. Hanson is the head of Hanson Robotics and Sophia\u2019s creator. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited about Sophia\u2019s career as an artist,\u201d he said. Hanson has been developing robots for the past 25 years. He believes realistic-looking robots can connect with people and assist in industries such as healthcare and education. Sophia is the most famous robot creation from Hanson Robotics. She can copy human facial expressions, hold conversations and recognize people. In 2017, she was given Saudi Arabian citizenship, becoming the world\u2019s first robot citizen. Hanson said he imagined Sophia \u201cas a creative artwork herself, that could generate art.\u201d In March, a digital artwork Sophia created jointly with Italian artist Andrea Bonaceto sold for $688,888 in the form of a non-fungible token, or NFT.   An NFT is something that only exists in the digital world. It is based on a technology called blockchain, which is also used with digital currency systems known as cryptocurrency. Blockchain is an online list containing information that can be used and shared within a large network open to the public. The technology permits pieces of information to be checked and stored safely. An NFT can be attached to a piece of digital artwork or other things existing in digital form. The NFT can be used to provide proof that the pieces are authentic. This is what permits digital artwork to be bought and sold. While anyone can view the work, the buyer has official ownership rights over the objects. The digital work that sold for $688,888 is titled \u201cSophia Instantiation.\u201d It is a 12-second video file which shows Bonaceto\u2019s portrait changing into Sophia\u2019s digital painting. Along with the digital file is the physical artwork painted by Sophia. The buyer, a digital artwork collector and artist known as 888, later sent Sophia a photo of his painted arm. The robot then added that image to her knowledge and painted more on top of her original piece. On the social media service Twitter, Sophia described the work as the first NFT shared work between an \u201cAI, a mechanical collective being and an artist-collector.\u201d Sophia\u2019s artwork selling as an NFT is part of a growing trend. In March, a digital artwork by artist Beeple sold for nearly $70 million, becoming the costliest digital artwork ever sold. I\u2019m Jonathan Evans.

The study -- by a team of American researchers -- comes as the U.S. makes plans to build a long-term base on the moon and prepares to send astronauts to Mars. Part of the study was based on the experiences of retired astronaut Scott Kelly. The U.S. space agency NASA says that during his career, Kelly spent more time in space than any other American astronaut. One of Kelly\u2019s stays aboard the International Space Station (ISS) lasted 340 days.  Researchers from the University of Texas\u2019 Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern) in Dallas examined physical data collected during Scott\u2019s long stay aboard the ISS. The goal was to learn the effects of weightlessness on heart health and performance. The team found that during Kelly\u2019s stay in space, the left ventricle of his heart shrank about 0.74 grams per week.   Dr. Benjamin Levine is a professor of internal medicine at UT Southwestern. He was the leader of the research. In a statement, he explained that because of the conditions in space, the heart does not have to work as hard to pump blood uphill from the feet. Over time, this can cause shrinkage. The heart has to work harder to keep blood flowing as it works against gravity, Levine explained. This permits the heart to keep its size and perform effectively. In an effort to keep their muscles and organs healthy in space, astronauts are required to perform different kinds of exercises throughout their stay. Reductions in heart size are also seen in patients who spend long periods in bed because they are lying flat and the heart does not have to work as hard to pump. In the astronaut experience, Levine said that even though the heart is good at adapting to changes in gravity, the exercise Kelly got was not enough to keep the heart unchanged. \u201cBoth the impact of gravity as well as the adaptive response to exercise play a role,\u201d he told the American Heart Association\u2019s (AHA) Circulation Journal Report. \u201cAnd we were surprised that even extremely long periods of low-intensity exercise did not keep the heart muscle from shrinking,\u201d Levine added.  Full results of the study recently appeared in the AHA\u2019s publication Circulation.  \nA second part of the study examined data from a long-distance swimmer who spent nearly a year trying to cross the Pacific Ocean. The swimmer, Beno\u00eet Lecomte, was chosen because he swam more than 2,800 kilometers over 159 days. Lecomte made it about a third of the way across the Pacific before deciding to stop because of bad weather and damage to a boat following him. Levine says long-distance swimming has similar effects to weightlessness because water pressure works against the force of gravity. The study showed that during Lecomte\u2019s swim, his left heart ventricle shrank about 0.72 grams per week. The researchers noted that both Kelly and Lecomte had nearly the same heart shrinkage level even though Lecomte exercised much more, swimming an average of six hours a day. Kelly spent one to two hours a day exercising in space.   Levine said he was somewhat surprised by this finding. But he noted that endurance swimming is not considered a \u201chigh-intensity\u201d exercise. So the health benefits from swimming were likely outweighed by the heart not having to work as hard to pump blood uphill. Even with the changes in both men, Levine said the overall heart function \u201cremained good\u201d throughout the study period. \u201cI think this is encouraging for long-duration space flight,\u201d he added. \u201cIt shows that even after a year in space, the heart adapts relatively well.\u201d The researchers say further study will be needed to confirm the latest findings as scientists attempt to create guidelines for future astronauts expected to spend long periods in space. Levine is prepared to lead some of those studies. He has worked with NASA on several projects in the past and the space agency recently awarded him $3.8 million to be used over the coming years to study the effects of space travel on the heart.

It is designed to do only one job: to move containers, or boxes, in large storage buildings called warehouses.  Michael Perry is vice president of business development for Boston Dynamics. He said Stretch is the first robot designed for one job that the company has built. He added that the robot was developed because of requests from companies around the world. \u201cWe heard pretty much universally across warehousing that truck unloading is one of the most physically difficult and unpleasant jobs... And that\u2019s where Stretch comes into play,\u201d Perry told Reuters. Stretch has a small base that permits it to move around small spaces in existing warehouses without having to redesign them. The robot also has an arm with highly developed cameras that can identify and deal with boxes of many shapes and sizes. Perry said Stretch can pick up boxes that weigh about 23 kilograms. He adds that the robot can move about 800 boxes in one hour. Boston Dynamics is known for YouTube videos of its dog-like \u2018Spot\u2019 and humanoid \u2018Atlas\u2019 robots. Perry said now is a good time for its latest robot to benefit from increasing demand for speedy home delivery. Experts say the warehousing industry experienced strong growth in 2020. That growth is expected to continue this year. They say online buying during the coronavirus health crisis drove the need for a huge expansion in delivery services. Boston Dynamics has not released a price for Stretch. But the company said the system can be set up without costly redesigns or investments in new buildings or structures. I\u2019m Jonathan Evans.

"}, {"title": "What Is an NFT?", "url": "https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/what-is-an-nft-/5834421.html", "topic": "Science & Technology", "text": "No media source currently available   You may have recently heard of NFT technology, which permits digital works of art to be collected and sold for millions of dollars. But why would people pay so much money for something they cannot even touch? And what is driving the current rise in NFTs? Here are some basics to help you understand the technology: What is an NFT? NFT stands for non-fungible token. It is something that only exists in the digital world. It is based on a technology called blockchain, which is also used with digital currency systems known as cryptocurrency.  What is blockchain? Blockchain is an online list containing information that can be used and shared within a large network open to the public. The technology permits pieces of information to be checked and stored safely. An NFT can be attached to a piece of digital artwork or other things existing in digital form. The NFT can be used to provide proof that the pieces are authentic. This is what permits digital artwork to be bought and sold. While anyone can view the work, the buyer has official ownership rights over the objects. \nWhat kinds of things are NFTs? NFTs can exist in the form of images, video, music and text. They are usually bought with electronic money. The form of digital currency mainly used with NFTs is called ether. NFTs have been used to sell sports videos, pieces of land in worlds that only exist on computers and even the first-ever tweet by Twitter\u2019s founder. A robot created a piece of art that was recently sold as an NFT. Why do people like NFTs? Artists like the idea of NFTs because the technology gives them a way to create and claim complete ownership over their digital works. This can make the artwork more rare, meaning the artists can sell their digital pieces for higher prices. Who is Beeple? One NFT piece was recently sold by an American digital artist known as Beeple. The artist, whose real name is Mike Winklemann, lives in South Carolina. His creation \u201cEverydays \u2013 The First 5000 Days\u201d -- a collection of 5,000 images -- sold in March for nearly $70 million. Because of the blockchain technology, Beeple will continue to earn money each time his art changes hands. He gets 10 percent of the price after every sale. Another American artist, Anne Spalter, sells some work as NFTs. At first, she did not think NFTs were a good idea, but then changed her mind. She says the technology has made people who might never go to an art gallery in person interested in art. However, she says she remains \u201cmystified\u201d by how high the prices went for some pieces. What do critics say about NFTs? Critics note that traditional art, like a painting, can be placed on a wall and looked at. But digital art is different. They point out that even though an artist can \u201cown\u201d a digital piece, others can easily save a copy of the same work as a file on their computer. Supporters of NFT technology note that such ownership means the digital artwork truly belongs to the artist, who can then sell it. Other people who have the same file on their computer or phone only own a copy. What does Beeple think? When asked about his artwork selling for such a high price, Beeple called it \u201ccrazy.\u201d Since the technology is new, not many people know what the future holds for NFT art. Some may grow in value while others may become worthless, Beeple said. He added that NFTs are giving people another way to invest outside of the stock market. \nWhat are some prices for NFTs? In February, a 10-second video showing an image of former U.S. President Donald Trump sold on an NFT marketplace for over $6 million. The first-ever published tweet from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey recently sold for nearly $3 million. He donated the money to an organization that supports families in Africa. But some NFTs sell for much less. Mark Cuban, a businessman and owner of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, sold a tweet for about $1000 in February. In January, a video of basketball star LeBron James sold for $100,000. That led American sports organizations to look at NFTs as a possible new way to earn money from their videos. Are NFTs good investments? It is too early to say if NFTs are good investments. But so far, many people have items that are worth more than what they paid for them. This is no guarantee, however, that such buyers will be able to sell their digital objects for a profit.  Max Dilendorf is a digital money lawyer in New York City. He says many people currently involved in NFT markets \u201care not really thinking it through carefully.\u201d At the same time, Dilendorf said he does expect NFTs to continue to grow. The New York Times made an NFT. What happened? The New York Times experimented with an NFT for a technology story that appeared in the newspaper. The story was called \u201cBuy This Column on the Blockchain!\u201d The writer, Kevin Roose, listed his column for sale in an NFT market called Foundation. It cost about $100 to list. The money raised from the article would go to a charity. In the story, Roose discussed how he put his column up for sale and also explained things the successful buyer would get. For example, the buyer was to be written about in a future story and would receive a message from a popular podcaster. The Times column sold for 350 ether. On March 25, that equaled about $560,000. So far, the winning buyer has not publicly come forward. \nWhat\u2019s next for digital art? Only two other living artists \u2013 Jeff Koons and David Hockney \u2013 have had their work sell for a price close to what Beeple\u2019s piece brought. And their art is physical, not digital. Some experts think artists whose work you can touch will be able to soon use blockchain technology to sell digital versions of their famous art. So what can we expect next? Among other things, a New York-based watch maker, Jacob & Co., plans to auction off a digital version of one of the company\u2019s real watches that sells for over $200,000. It hopes the NFT will bring in at least that much in the April auction. I\u2019m Dan Friedell. And I\u2019m Bryan Lynn.

The device, worn on the wrist, is designed to work with glasses to create an augmented reality, or AR, experience. AR is a technology that uses glasses to project computer-created images onto a user\u2019s view of the real world.  Facebook recently described its device in a report on its website. The social media service said the technology would permit users to enter virtual worlds, where they could control different objects simply with finger movements. The AR system is expected to \u201ctransform the way we connect with people near and far\u201d in the future, Facebook said.  \u201cImagine being able to teleport anywhere in the world to have shared experiences with the people who matter most in your life -- no matter where they happen to be,\u201d said Andrew Bosworth. He is the head of Facebook\u2019s Reality Labs.   In the past, Facebook has mostly centered its AR development on improving gaming experiences. Now, it is aiming to expand the technology to be used in more everyday ways. With this goal in mind, Facebook said one of the most important considerations was to find the right kind of device to control the AR glasses. It would have to be easy to use, wearable, always available and powerful enough to perform complex actions. The company decided a wristband would be the best choice. The device will use a technology known as electromyography, or EMG, to translate complex hand movements. EMG measures electrical activity in muscles when they move. Sensors will \u201ctranslate electrical motor nerve signals that travel through the wrist to the hand into digital commands that you can use to control the functions of a device,\u201d Facebook said.   These signals -- which start in the brain and travel through the wrist -- are so clear that EMG can understand finger movements as small as one millimeter, the company said. It added that in the future, \u201cit may even be possible to sense just the intention to move a finger.\u201d Facebook shared pictures and video of experiments it carried out with a research model of the wristband. One video splits the view to show a virtual hand copying the movements of a real hand that is wearing the wristband. The hand appears to control a moving piece in a projected virtual world. Another video shows a demonstration in which a person wearing the wristband uses fingers to type on a surface without the need for a keyboard. Facebook said this kind of virtual keyboard could actually learn an individual\u2019s way of typing and make changes to fit it. Another use of the wristband could permit users to click on controls that only exist virtually. The goal is to create \u201ccomputing experiences where the human is the absolute center of the entire experience,\u201d Facebook said.   Industry experts see Facebook\u2019s product plans as progress in the race among major technology companies to develop AR glasses. Companies including Google, Apple and Amazon have suggested such technology could someday replace smartphones. Facebook said earlier that smart glasses would need to depend on devices like phones because of limitations on electric power and the heat produced during use. A wristband could help support those computing needs. In September, Facebook said it was about five to 10 years away from being able to bring to market \u201ctrue\u201d AR glasses that would permit users to interact with shared virtual objects.

That seems to be the case for Godzilla vs. Kong, a movie about a battle between the two huge monsters. It is one of the few blockbusters to be released while COVID-19-related restrictions are still in effect.  Godzilla vs. Kong opened last week with $9.6 million in ticket sales. That is a one-day record during the pandemic. Before its U.S. opening, the film made $123.1 million internationally in late March. Joshua Grode is the head of Legendary Entertainment, which produced Godzilla vs. Kong.

People remain concerned about sitting in a closed room with many other moviegoers. It also is very easy to watch a movie from home. Many films in the past year have been released through streaming services like HBO Max, Netflix or Disney+. For example, in addition to being shown in theaters, Godzilla vs. Kong is available for streaming in North America on HBO Max. Ticket sales are slowly starting to rise but remain below normal. The top earning release of 2021 was Tom & Jerry, with $13.7 million in sales in February. Wonder Woman 1984 had the biggest launch during the pandemic, with $16.7 million in December. Both of these movies were also released on streaming services. Rich Gelfond is the head of IMAX, a specialized theater company. He said the success of Godzilla vs. Kong might persuade film companies to release more new movies. Movie companies are concerned about releasing costly films while restrictions on public gatherings remain in place. While movie going in much of Asia has recovered, increases in COVID-19 cases in Europe and other countries have made a worldwide release impossible. Godzilla vs. Kong cost about $160 million to make.

The murderer in this story is an English pirate who became the world\u2019s most-wanted criminal. His crime? He attacked and robbed a ship carrying Muslims traveling home to India from Mecca. The pirate then escaped capture by posing as a slave trader. It is \u201ca new history of a nearly perfect crime,\u201d Jim Bailey told the Associated Press.  He is an amateur historian who found an 17th-century Arabian coin in Middletown, Rhode Island. That ancient coin is one of the oldest ever found in North America. And it could explain how pirate Captain Henry Every disappeared from history. Here is the story\u2026 On September 7, 1695, a pirate ship named Fancy under Every\u2019s command captured the Ganj-i-Sawai. That ship belonged to Indian emperor Aurangzeb. At the time, the Indian emperor was one of the most powerful men in the world. Aboard the ship were Muslims returning from Mecca and tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of gold and silver. Historical records say Captain Every and his men tortured and killed the men and raped the women aboard the Indian ship. Then they escaped to the Bahamas, a safe place for pirates at that time. When word of the crimes reached English King William III, he set a large price for the capture of the pirates. Today Bailey said, \u201cIf you Google \u2018first worldwide manhunt,\u2019 it comes up as Every.\u201d Everyone, he added, was looking for the pirates at the time. Until now, historians only knew that Every eventually sailed to Ireland in 1696 and disappeared. But Bailey said the coins, he and others have found, prove that the pirate and his crew had first come to the American colonies. They used the coins for day-to-day expenses during their escape. \nWhile using his metal detector at Sweet Berry Farm in Middletown, Rhode Island, Bailey got a signal. He dug down and found a darkened, dime-sized silver coin. At first, he thought it was either a Spanish coin or one made by the Massachusetts Bay Colony. However, after a close look, he got very excited. He saw Arabic text on the coin. He said to himself, \u201cOh my God.\u201d Research confirmed that the coin was made in 1693 in Yemen. Since Bailey\u2019s discovery, others have found 15 more Arabian coins from the same time period. One coin was found in North Carolina, where records show some of Every\u2019s men first landed. Another coin was found in 2018 at a farm in Connecticut. Bailey said Every was able to hide by posing as a slave trader. On his way to the Bahamas, Bailey explained, the pirate even stopped at the French island of Reunion to get some Black captives so he would look the part. Other little-known records show the pirates left the Fancy and used a ship called the Sea Flower to sail along the Eastern coastline. It arrived with some slaves in 1696 in Newport, Rhode Island, then a center of the North American slave trade. Bailey, who has a degree in anthropology from the University of Rhode Island, published his findings in the research publication American Numismatic Society.   \u201cJim\u2019s research is impeccable,\u201d said Kevin McBride, a professor of archaeology at the University of Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s really a pretty interesting story,\u201d he said. Hollywood thinks so, too. A movie about Captain Every will be released by Sony Pictures in early 2022. For Bailey, \u201cIt\u2019s always been about the thrill of the hunt, not about the money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing better than finding these objects is the long-lost stories behind them.\u201d I\u2019m Anna Matteo.

Others observe the Jewish holiday of Passover. And many are looking to the arrival of spring. Easter is when Christians celebrate the life of Jesus and what they believe was his return from the dead. For most Christians, Easter this year is on Sunday, April 4. For Eastern Orthodox Christians, May 2 is Orthodox Easter Sunday. You may wonder why the date for Easter changes every year. It is one of the \"movable feasts\" that change each year. In English, the word \"feast\" can mean a religious festival as well as a large dinner. We have both of these on Easter and Passover. Date tied to the Moon In the early days of Christianity, leaders decided to set the date of Easter for the first Sunday following the first full moon of the Spring season.

Many Christians in America attend religious services on Easter Sunday. Some of these services take place at sunrise. Children are often told stories about the Easter Bunny. He is said to hide eggs, chocolates and other sweet treats, for children to find on Easter morning. The Easter Bunny tradition probably developed from a German celebration of spring. Germans first settled in North America in the eighteenth century. Individual families and groups also organize Easter egg hunts for children. The best-known egg hunt in America is the event called the White House Easter Egg Roll. The president and the first family usually join children in hunting for eggs, playing games, and reading stories. However for a second year, the White House has cancelled the event because of COVID-19.   Passover American Jews observe Passover around the same time as Easter. Passover began this year on the evening of Saturday, March 27 and ends on the evening of Sunday, April 4. Passover celebrates the Jews' escape from slavery in Egypt, called the Exodus. The Jewish holy book, the Torah, tells about how Moses led the Jews to freedom. A special dinner, the seder, begins the celebration of Passover. Jewish families get together and eat foods that represent the Exodus story. One food is matzoh, a flat, crisp bread. It represents the hurry linked to the slaves\u2019 escape. They did not have time to let their bread rise before baking it. Another special food on the seder table is maror, bitter herbs. They represent the pain of slavery.   Easter around the world One of our French readers tells VOA about an Easter tradition in France, where many Roman Catholics live. Churches in France do not ring their bells on the two days before Easter Sunday. The bells are silenced in honor of the death of Jesus. They ring again on Easter Sunday, the day Christians believe he came back to life. French children are told a story about why the bells are quiet. Parents say the bells have flown to Rome to see the pope, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. But on Sunday morning, the bells return and ring again. The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Easter on May 2 this year. Orthodox Christians in America celebrate by blessing food baskets. In Greece, people color hard-boiled eggs and play a game by knocking them together. They eat lamb and party into the late night. \nOther spring celebrations In Japan, spring is marked with a cherry blossom festival, known as hanami. The tradition dates back more than a thousand years. People gather under the blooming trees to eat, drink tea, celebrate and enjoy the cherry blossoms, known as sakura in Japanese. Artists and poets celebrate the short-lived blooms as a symbol of beauty. For many countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, the beginning of spring also marks the beginning of a new year. The celebration is called Nowruz. The words \"now\" and \"ruz\" means \u201cnew day\u201d in Farsi. The International Day of Nowruz was on March 20 this year. During Nowruz, people visit family members and friends and exchange gifts. Iranian families set up a \u201chaft seen\" - a presentation of seven special items that represent spring and new beginnings. They include eggs, a live goldfish, a vegetable, and other foods. Many in India and Nepal mark the arrival of spring with the Holi festival, also known as the festival of colors or festival of love. Holi was on Monday, March 29 this year. Many Indians ignored social distancing restrictions in the big cities of New Delhi and Mumbai. They celebrated the festival by covering each other in -- you guessed it -- colors!   No matter what your culture or religion, it seems we all love spring. Spring weather is a welcome change for many people this year. Thanks to vaccines, families can once again meet and enjoy their \"movable feasts.\" I\u2019m Jill Robbins. And I'm Caty Weaver.

Toledo has made jewelry for the musical \u201cEvita\u201d on Broadway in New York. He has created special pieces for people like former U.S. President Barack Obama and singer Madonna. Toledo was among the first in Argentina to become infected with COVID-19 a year ago. He was hospitalized for eight days. The experience affected him deeply.

The waste materials include old vaccines and newspaper stories about the pandemic. \u201cI am excited to be able to transform pain into beauty and this exhibition is just that, capturing everything that is happening to us as a society,\u201d Toledo told Reuters reporters. His latest works of art will go on show in September in a public area in Buenos Aires. They will all be made from materials that people have sent him. \u201cIt is the first time that I do an exhibition in which I do not have to buy any of the elements,\u201d he said. Part of the exhibition includes a ship that crosses a \u201cstorm,\u201d as well as recycling islands.  \u201cThe exhibition will tell the story of this ship that went sailing and was stranded after the storm, which is a great metaphor for what is happening to us,\u201d Toledo said.

The first day of games is known as Opening Day. For most baseball fans, it is the first time they have been able to see their favorite teams and players since the end of the 2019 season. In 2020, the season started late, and fans were not permitted to come to games during the COVID-19 pandemic. By October, some fans could go to games in controlled environments called bubbles. The Los Angeles Dodgers won the season\u2019s final game and became champions. Opening Day Historically, Opening Day signals the arrival of spring after a long winter. And baseball fans are filled with excitement and optimism.   But this year will be different. Fans are still excited and optimistic, but they are also worried about returning to group events. The Washington Post conducted a poll of sports fans with the help of the University of Maryland. It found that less than half of Americans would feel comfortable attending a sporting event. More fans said they would feel better about attending an outdoor game like baseball compared to an indoor game such as basketball. Also, they would feel better about going to a game if fans were required to wear face coverings, tested for the virus or received a vaccine. Cities around the U.S. with baseball teams are cutting back the number of fans who can attend. The famous New York Yankees baseball team will let about 10,000 fans attend the games. The fans will need to be vaccinated or tested for the virus. In Washington, D.C., about 5,000 people will be able to go to games in the first part of the season. They will be required to sit apart from each other and keep their faces covered most of the time.   \u201cI hope that those 5,000, at least at the start who are allowed in, kind of realize how lucky they are just to be there. You know, 35,000 every night at least who would happily trade places with them and deal with the protocols in place.\u201d That is Scott Allen. He is a sports writer for the Washington Post. The poll from the Washington Post does note, however, that sports fans are more at ease with the idea of attending games today than they were at this time last year. About 65 percent said going to a game in May 2020 was \u201ca large risk.\u201d Now that number is down to 26 percent. One person who is willing to take the risk is a baseball fan named Greg. He was walking with his family outside the Washington Nationals ballpark on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m taking my dad. I missed sitting in the seats, watching the game and drinking a beer. Just the whole ballpark atmosphere.\u201d There were others, however, who wanted to wait and see how the first part of the season went before going back to the games. Dan Sullivan was with a friend at a coffee shop near the Washington Nationals home. He said he will wait to be vaccinated before going to a game. He does not mind missing Opening Day. \u201cI hope the people who are there are going to enjoy it, but most people are not there,\u201d he said. Since so few fans are allowed, he does not feel as if he is missing out. Allen, the Washington Post writer, said even with Opening Day being so different, he thinks fans will see it as a return to normalcy. \u201c[The baseball season] is way to mark time and important moments in your life. People couldn\u2019t do that last year, and I think it hurt them. It feels more like the start of spring and what should be an enjoyable summer when you know that almost every day you\u2019re going to be able to turn on the baseball game, or go to see your favorite team.\u201d I\u2019m Dan Friedell.

In the western city of Dusseldorf, many bars and restaurants are at least partly closed because of COVID-19 restrictions. The rules have been in place since November 2020. As a result, not as many people are buying beer. So the beer maker, Fuechschen Brewery, had 6,000 liters of its product that were about to go bad. Instead of throwing the beer away, the brewery asked some bread bakers for help. Many bakers already use grain left over from the brewing process in their bread. Fuechschen Brewery\u2019s Altbier is now an important ingredient in a special bread called \u201ctreberbrot.\u201d About 12 bakers in the area are now making loaves of \u201ctreberbrot,\u201d which means used-grain bread. Peter Koenig\u2019s family has run the brewery since 1908. \u201cIt would have been such a shame to just toss out such a tasty beer,\u201d he said. The bakers use the beer instead of water in their recipe. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that these two craft industries have come together like this,\u201d Koenig said.   Around Dusseldorf, people can buy a loaf of the special bread for less than five dollars. Each purchase comes with a bottle of beer. Janika Derksen\u2019s family runs Coelven Bakery. She said the brown bread tastes very good with a hard outside \u201cand a soft middle.\u201d People from other parts of Germany are calling to find out if the bakery can send them loaves of the bread.

The EMA announcement is the latest setback for a low-cost vaccine that was once called a \u201cvaccine for the world.\u201d The AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved for emergency use in over 100 countries including Britain and the European Union. The vaccine is also a large part of the United Nations COVAX program to provide COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries. The agency advised that blood system blockages should be listed as \u201cside effects\u201d of the vaccine. It said women under the age of 60 represent most of the cases of blood clots reported so far. The problems, the agency said, happened within two weeks of vaccination. The EMA said it was not \u201cpossible to identify specific risk factors.\u201d EMA chief Emer Cooke spoke to reporters Wednesday. She said the risk of death from COVID is much greater than the risk of death from these side effects. The EMA and the World Health Organization have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective. Setbacks from the start Early in the pandemic, the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Britain\u2019s University of Oxford, was considered a leading candidate against the coronavirus. It costs much less than other vaccines. It also does not require extreme cold storage, making it easier to use in countries with limited resources. Last September, the company temporarily suspended the trials of the vaccine after a volunteer in Britain developed inflammation in her spine. It was later found to be unrelated to the vaccine but led to a long delay in the United States. In March, about 13 European countries suspended their use of AstraZeneca vaccine after reports of possible blood clots linked to the shot. Most restarted with some age restrictions after the EMA said countries should continue to use the vaccine. A week later, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. health agency, released an unusual statement saying that \u201cAstraZeneca might have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.\u201d On Wednesday, the Reuters news agency reported that EU health ministers planned to meet after the EMA\u2019s announcement. Even officials in Asia said they were waiting to hear the EMA\u2019s decision. South Korea had temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine in people 60 and younger. The country\u2019s health officials said Wednesday that they would also pause a plan to vaccinate teachers that was to begin on Thursday, while awaiting the results of the EMA\u2019s review. Dr. Peter English was a former head of the British Medical Association\u2019s Public Health Medicine Committee. He said questions over the vaccine could have serious consequences around the world.

Not so long ago, orchids were considered rare and exotic flowers \u2013 difficult to find and difficult to grow. But these days, thanks to new growing methods, some kinds of orchids are available in many parts of the world. Marc Hachadourian is an orchid expert at the New York Botanical Garden. He said orchids are now \u201cthe most popular blooming florist crop in the world.\u201d A florist is a person who sells flowers. Hachadourian recently told the Associated Press that orchids are not only beautiful, but they are good to grow at home. The blooms are long-lasting. Orchid flowers can last for weeks. Orchids offer an easy, low-cost way to brighten up a room. The flowers come in many colors. Once the flowers die, however, many people might want to throw the plant away. But not so fast! You might be able to get that orchid to bloom again. In fact, helping an orchid to rebloom is a great project to do while at home because of coronavirus restrictions. Just know that the pandemic might be over by the time you succeed.   Kenya Friend-Daniel is an orchid expert at Trader Joe\u2019s, a food store that also sells plants and flowers like orchids. Once the first flowers are gone, Friend-Daniel suggests cutting the stem off at the base and removing the material the plant is growing in. Then move the plant to a slightly larger pot filled with fresh moss or tree bark. Friend-Daniel said that, \u201cnew growth should start coming from the middle of the plant within three to four months.\u201d It will take 12 months for a fully bloomed flower to show. Blanche Wagner is another orchid expert. She says that orchids use a lot of energy to produce blooms. \u201cThey need a full year,\u201d she added, \u201cto build up enough energy to flower again.\u201d Wagner works at the Missouri Botanical Garden. Their orchid collection is world-famous and dates back to the late 1800s. She gives a simple suggestion for those wanting to rebloom an orchid: Note when you bought them. This will help you to re-bloom your flower at the best time.   And remember to care for them when they are not in bloom. The most important time to care for your plants is right after the flowers die, said Hachadourian. At that time, he said, \u201cmake sure they get the best available light, water, and fertilizer to make sure they grow their best before flowering again.\u201d How warm? Wild orchids grow in rainforests. So, they do well in warm, wet environments. Morning sun is best, says Kenya Friend-Daniel. But avoid direct sunlight, she warns, which can burn the leaves and the blooms. The ideal temperature while waiting for new growth is about 29 degrees Celsius. Once there is new growth, keep the temperature between 21 to 24 degrees Celsius. How much water? Watering orchids is also tricky. How often you water depends on the material you use to plant the flower and also the temperature.  Friend-Daniel said putting water on the roots every day is best. If the plant is growing in bark you could water it once a week in cooler weather and every four to five days in warmer weather. However, never let the roots sit in water. This will cause them to rot, and the plant will die.   \u201cMost failures with orchids are because of overwatering,\" said Hachadourian. He adds that a small amount of water once or twice a week will keep the plant just wet enough without being over wet. Fertilizer or not? You can also fertilize orchids -- but not too much. Too much fertilizer can also kill the roots. Surprise of new orchid blooms. If you do get new flowers, you may be in for a surprise. Some growers inject color chemicals into the orchid. This makes them bloom bright blue, yellow, orange, or green. Those colored orchids rebloom white. Whatever color your new blooms are, Hachadourian said the \u201ctake-home message\u201d is a good one: \u201cPeople are reblooming their orchids more than once.\u201d So, maybe it is good time to grow your own. But Friend-Daniel reminds us that orchids are complex. \u201cNo one said it was easy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s work.\u201d But the results may be worth it.

The news may lead to vaccinating that age group before they return to school in the autumn. Most COVID-19 vaccines available are for adults, who are at higher risk from the coronavirus. Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is approved for children ages 16 and older. But vaccinating children of all ages might be important to stopping the spread of the coronavirus. In a study of 2,260 U.S. volunteers ages 12 to 15, early results showed there were no cases of COVID-19 among those fully vaccinated. There were 18 cases of coronavirus infection among those given a placebo, Pfizer reported.  The study was small and has not yet been published. However, researchers reported high levels of antibodies, somewhat higher than were seen in studies of young adults. The children had side effects that were similar to those of young adults, the company said. The main side effects are pain, high temperature, chills and tiredness, especially after the second injection. The study will continue to follow the children for two years for more information about protection and safety. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech plan in the coming weeks to ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulators to permit emergency use of the vaccine starting at age 12. \u201cWe share the urgency to expand the use of our vaccine,\u201d Pfizer cheif Albert Bourla said in a statement. He expressed \u201cthe hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year\u201d in the United States.  Pfizer is not the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Results also are expected by the middle of this year from a U.S. study of Moderna\u2019s vaccine in 12 to 17 year olds. Because the findings were promising, the FDA already permitted both companies to begin U.S. studies on children 11 and younger. They plan to study children as young as 6 months old in the future. The chief of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin said in a statement: \u201cWe are longing for a normal life. This is especially true for our children.\u201d AstraZeneca last month began a study of its vaccine on children ages 6 to 17 in Britain. Johnson & Johnson is planning its own studies. In China, Sinovac recently announced it has given new data to Chinese regulators showing its vaccine is safe in children as young as 3. One important question is the amount of vaccine: Pfizer gave the 12-and-older children the same amount as adults. It is testing different amounts in younger children. It is unclear how quickly the FDA would act on Pfizer\u2019s request to permit vaccination starting at age 12. The agency has taken about three weeks to study and approve each of the vaccines now available for adults.  Children represent about 13 percent of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Children are far less likely than adults to get seriously sick. However, at least 268 children have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. and more than 13,500 have been hospitalized, the American Academy of Pediatrics reports. A small number have developed serious swelling linked to the coronavirus. Caleb Chung, who turns 13 later this week, was one of the volunteers for the vaccine study.

In 2020, many people in the United States found an escape by going out into nature and open places. Hiking trails, parks and other outdoor spaces were very busy with people searching for fresh air during coronavirus health crisis restrictions. People, who were staying at home and whose gyms were closed, took their exercise to the \u201cGreat Outdoors.\u201d Sports such as hiking, biking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, camping, tennis, and golf all became more popular. In 2021, that seems to be continuing. People are still finding ways to play outdoors within coronavirus restrictions and stay-at-home guidelines. The Outdoor Foundation is part of the Outdoor Industry Association, a trade group. It released numbers comparing Americans' outdoor activities in 2019 and 2020. The group said 8.1 million more Americans went hiking, 7.9 million more went camping and 3.4 million more people went freshwater fishing in 2020 than in the year before. In 2020, the foundation\u2019s research also found a 52.9 percent increase in outdoor activity for most age groups and all income levels. \u201cIt\u2019s both heartening and a little bit mind-blowing to think how things are going this year,\u201d said Richard Hodges. He is the director at White Pine Touring in Park City, Utah. \nCross-country skiing Cross-country skiing has become much more popular. It is skiing that is done over the countryside instead of down a mountain. \u201cEvery single day of the week is like a weekend day,\u201d said Hodges. The park in Utah where he works has about 20 kilometers of paths. He said there seems to be a \u201climitless interest right now in cross-country skiing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been really fun \u2014 a lot of work, but really fun. All we\u2019re doing is trying to get people outside to go play in the snow.\u201d Hiking The popularity of some outdoor sports comes as no surprise to Sandra Marra. She is the president and business chief of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. It is a non-profit organization that helps keep up the Appalachian Trail in the Eastern United States. More hikers have been walking along the Appalachian Trail since the beginning of the health crisis. The trail is about 3,540 kilometers long and goes through 14 states. It gets more than 3 million visitors each year. Marra told the Associated Press that many people, who never really exercised outdoors, found easy-to-use trails and spaces near their homes. However, she warns people not to do too much. \u201c\u2026We\u2019re finding a lot of people are out there not prepared for just how rugged this trail is. It\u2019s not a walk on the bike trail in the middle of the city,\u201d she said. She also warns to be careful when going out for a long nature walk. She suggests hikers study weather reports and information about wildlife in the area. They should wear the right clothes for the right weather. And they should also bring supplies and maps. \nGolf Golf remains popular as well. The U.S. National Golf Foundation said that Americans played almost 502 million rounds of golf in 2020. The number of golfers in the U.S. increased by half a million in 2020 to 24.8 million, the group found. The sport also grew around the world. Golf Australia said golfing has increased up to 15 percent since the restrictions went into effect. Already popular in Sweden, the number of golf rounds played increased 42 percent. And Golf Olivar de la Hinojosa in Spain had an increase of 30 percent. Ana Fern\u00e1ndez de Diego is a Spanish professional golfer and teaches the sport. She said the level of growth in the sport has not been seen before. \u201cGolf is one of the things that people can do without any risks now,\u201d she said. Tennis Tennis is also more popular. The United States Tennis Association, or USTA, said that in 2020 there was nearly three million first-time players. In all, more than 21.6 million Americans played the game on tennis courts last year. Mike Dowse is chief of the USTA. He said on its website that many people see \u201ctennis as the ideal social-distancing sport.\u201d From hiking to tennis and golf to cold weather sports \u2013 businesses are happy to the see the outdoor exercising activities get more popular. Marra, of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, also sees it as a great thing for the environment. With more people using the outdoors, it may be more likely they will take care of it. \u201cThis is the new future for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe new reality.\u201d And that\u2019s the Health & Lifestyle report.

He makes chocolate. In the 1990s, he co-created an international chocolate company called Max Brenner Chocolate. His businesses included a 650-square-meter store on Broadway in New York City. Then in 2012, Brenner left that business. A few years later, he began exploring a different side of chocolate. In 2015, during a trip to Jamaica, he developed a love and excitement for the fruit that produces chocolate: cacao. The Jamaican people taught him a lot about cacao -- namely, it is more than just chocolate. Brenner saw Jamaican people making juice, liquor, and flour from the cacao fruit. And they used the whole fruit \u2013 not just the beans. Brenner told the Associated Press that although he had worked with chocolate for 20 years, he knew little about cacao. \u201cIt is the most unknown fruit behind the most known fruit,\u201d Brenner said. While the fruit might have been unknown to him, it is not unknown to the people of Jamaica and other countries like Ecuador. The Ecuadorian people also taught Brenner how to use cacao.

So, he has created new products that celebrate the traditional side of chocolate-making and the natural taste of the cacao fruit. Health experts have long noted the possible good effects that chocolate can have on health. The T.H. Chan Harvard School of Public Health says on its website that the dark chocolate produced from cacao has many necessary nutrients. These include iron, copper, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and substances called flavanols. Brenner said the unsweetened fruit has other nutrients as well. Cacao is high in antioxidants. And the water is full of natural chemicals called electrolytes. These are substances needed in the body\u2019s fluids to control important processes including how your body uses vitamins and minerals and removes waste.  In addition to health, Brenner said that the cacao he uses for his products is farmed in a way that is not harmful to the environment. And it is also fair to the farmers.  I\u2019m Anna Matteo.

The two are now known for doing important work on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the coronavirus. But they started their company to work on a cure for cancer. In fact, the doctors started a different company about 20 years ago to work on cancer drugs. They sold that company for about $1 billion in 2016. BioNTech was looking for a way to cause the body\u2019s immune system to fight tumors with a technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA. In early 2020, Tureci and Sahin heard about a new virus that was infecting people in China. They thought they could find a way to use their technology to fight it. They had already been working with Pfizer on a new influenza vaccine. They created a new project, to find a vaccine for the new coronavirus, and called it \u201cProject Lightspeed.\u201d Within 11 months, Britain approved use of the coronavirus vaccine they developed working with Pfizer. One week later, the U.S. approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use. Now, tens of millions of people around the world have received their vaccine. Tureci said she was not worried about finding a way to make a coronavirus vaccine. Instead, she was worried about how her small company would create enough of the vaccine for all who would need it. Pfizer and BioNTech worked with a Chinese company called Fosun Pharma to increase their ability to produce the vaccine. \u201cIt pays off to make bold decisions and to trust that if you have an extraordinary team, you will be able to solve any problem and obstacle which comes your way in real time,\u201d Tureci told the Associated Press. She said working together with international companies was important to their success. \nFuture of mRNA The vaccine from Moderna also uses mRNA technology. Treatments of this kind use mRNA to carry instructions that tell the body to make proteins that attack viruses. Tureci and Sahin said they think they can do the same thing for cancer tumors. \u201cWe have several different cancer vaccines based on mRNA,\u201d Tureci said. She said she thinks BioNTech will develop its cancer drugs so they can be offered to people within a few years. Right now, however, the company is continuing to work to be sure it can fulfill coronavirus vaccine orders and deal with variants of the virus. Tureci said people should trust that all of the vaccines are safe for people to use. She said the vaccines were developed quickly, but still observed \"a very rigid process.\" She said officials around the world are paying careful attention to how people react to the vaccines from BioNTech and other drug companies. National honor Germany recognized what its two citizens did for the world in developing a successful vaccine. Tureci and Sahin received the Order of Merit on March 19. It is one of Germany\u2019s highest honors. Germany\u2019s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier presented the award while Chancellor Angela Merkel attended. Tureci said she was pleased to be recognized. But she said many people deserve credit for helping with the vaccine. \u201cIt\u2019s about the effort of many,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way we see it, this is an acknowledgment of this effort and also a celebration of science.\u201d I\u2019m Dan Friedell.
